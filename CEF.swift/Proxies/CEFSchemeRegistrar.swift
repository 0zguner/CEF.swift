    /// Register a custom scheme. This method should not be called for the built-in

    /// If |is_standard| is true the scheme will be treated as a standard scheme.
    /// Standard schemes are subject to URL canonicalization and parsing rules as
    /// defined in the Common Internet Scheme Syntax RFC 1738 Section 3.1 available
    /// at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1738.txt
    /// In particular, the syntax for standard scheme URLs must be of the form:
    /// <pre>
    /// [scheme]://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[url-path]
    /// </pre>
    /// Standard scheme URLs must have a host component that is a fully qualified
    /// domain name as defined in Section 3.5 of RFC 1034 [13] and Section 2.1 of
    /// RFC 1123. These URLs will be canonicalized to "scheme://host/path" in the
    /// simplest case and "scheme://username:password@host:port/path" in the most
    /// explicit case. For example, "scheme:host/path" and "scheme:///host/path"
    /// will both be canonicalized to "scheme://host/path". The origin of a
    /// standard scheme URL is the combination of scheme, host and port (i.e.,
    /// "scheme://host:port" in the most explicit case).
    /// For non-standard scheme URLs only the "scheme:" component is parsed and
    /// canonicalized. The remainder of the URL will be passed to the handler
    /// as-is. For example, "scheme:///some%20text" will remain the same.
    /// Non-standard scheme URLs cannot be used as a target for form submission.
    /// If |is_local| is true the scheme will be treated as local (i.e., with the
    /// same security rules as those applied to "file" URLs). Normal pages cannot
    /// link to or access local URLs. Also, by default, local URLs can only perform
    /// XMLHttpRequest calls to the same URL (origin + path) that originated the
    /// request. To allow XMLHttpRequest calls from a local URL to other URLs with
    /// the same origin set the CefSettings.file_access_from_file_urls_allowed
    /// value to true. To allow XMLHttpRequest calls from a local URL to all
    /// origins set the CefSettings.universal_access_from_file_urls_allowed value
    /// to true.
    /// If |is_display_isolated| is true the scheme will be treated as display-
    /// isolated. This means that pages cannot display these URLs unless they are
    /// from the same scheme. For example, pages in another origin cannot create
    /// iframes or hyperlinks to URLs with this scheme.
    /// This function may be called on any thread. It should only be called once
    /// per unique |scheme_name| value. If |scheme_name| is already registered or
    /// if an error occurs this method will return false.
