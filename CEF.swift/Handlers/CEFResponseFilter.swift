    ///     be NULL if |data_in_size| is zero.
    ///  B. Write filtered output data to |data_out| and set |data_out_written| to
    ///     the number of bytes that were written up to a maximum of
    ///     |data_out_size|. If no output data was written then all data must be
    ///     read from |data_in| (user must set |data_in_read| = |data_in_size|).
    ///  C. Return RESPONSE_FILTER_DONE if all output data was written or
    ///     RESPONSE_FILTER_NEED_MORE_DATA if output data is still pending.
    ///
    /// This method will be called repeatedly until the input buffer has been
    /// fully read (user sets |data_in_read| = |data_in_size|) and there is no
    /// more input data to filter (the resource response is complete). This method
    /// may then be called an additional time with an empty input buffer if the
    /// user filled the output buffer (set |data_out_written| = |data_out_size|)
    /// and returned RESPONSE_FILTER_NEED_MORE_DATA to indicate that output data is
    /// still pending.
    ///
    /// Calls to this method will stop when one of the following conditions is met:
    ///
    ///  A. There is no more input data to filter (the resource response is
    ///     complete) and the user sets |data_out_written| = 0 or returns
    ///     RESPONSE_FILTER_DONE to indicate that all data has been written, or;
    ///  B. The user returns RESPONSE_FILTER_ERROR to indicate an error.
    ///
    /// Do not keep a reference to the buffers passed to this method.
